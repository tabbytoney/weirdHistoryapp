      "Washington's death is believed to be either from illness or from the treatment of that illness.  On December 12, 1799, he had spent hours outside in the snow on horseback working on his farm. Not wanting to keep his guests waiting, he didn’t change before dinner and wore cold, wet clothing the entire evening. He complained of a sore throat, then congestion. The next day he had difficulty breathing and swallowing. At the time, bloodletting was used for many ailments with the idea of getting the “bad stuff” out. The first time of bloodletting took about a pint of Washington’s blood. Three doctors total took his blood, draining him of at least half the blood in his body. A tracheotomy was performed as a last effort but didn’t help. Washington died two days after his initial illness. He had asked that his body not be buried for three days, possibly due to a fear of being buried alive. He and his wife are interred at the crypt at Mount Vernon. An ex employee of the estate tried to steal Washington’s skull, so a better vault was built with the original body still inside the lead coffin but now placed inside and sealed within a marble sarcophagi.",

      'September 1848, Phineas Gage was struck in the head with a tamping iron. Gage, the foreman of a railroad crew, was working in Vermont to clear rocks out of hills to allow the installation of railroad tracks. However, on this day in 1848, he was injured in a grave manner. Normally, rock is removed out of the path of a railroad through blasting it apart. Workers will make a hole in the rock and fill it with gunpower. A fuse is snaked down into the hole and then a worker fills it with soil. Then a foreman would tamp down the soil with his tamping iron. The fuse would be lit, blasting the rock to bits. Gage used his tamping iron in such a hole, but no soil had been added on top of the gunpowder. The iron made a spark, which ignited the gunpowder. This explosion blew the tamping iron up under Gage’s cheekbone, through the frontal lobe of his brain, and through the rest of his skull. The iron flew 25 feet away, taking a bit of Gage’s brain with it.',

    description:
      "Pervitin was available over-the-counter as a alertness pill and to counter depression. The Wehrmacht (German) authorities provided Pervitin to their soldiers. They believed that with the pill enabling soldiers to function without sleep for days at a time and march for miles without rest, they could easily win World War II. In 1940, Germany sent more than 35 million tablets of Pervitin and a similar drug called Isophan to the front lines. Commanders loved their soldiers on meth, I mean Pervitin: 'Everyone fresh and cheerful, excellent discipline. Slight euphoria and increased thirst for action. Mental encouragement, very stimulated. No accidents. Long-lasting effect. After taking four tablets, double vision and seeing colors.' Meth fueled the insanely fast Blitzkrieg invasion of France through the Ardennes mountains. The Germans were able to make it through a grueling march through mountains and then immediately attack and defeat French forces. In addition to be able to function without sleep, the drug also reduced feelings of fear in German soldiers. They would go berserker, and charge machine gun nests. This intimidated their enemies, who began to view them as inhuman 'super soldiers.' Hitler himself may not have taken Pervitin, but he was directly injected with Eukodal, oxycodone with cocaine, to keep him peppy. He regularly received injections of several types of drugs, including barbiturates, bull semen, testosterone, opiates, and other stimulants.",
